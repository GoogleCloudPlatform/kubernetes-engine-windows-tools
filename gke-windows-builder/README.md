# Description

This tool is used to create a Docker container image that can build Windows
multi-arch container images using Google Cloud Build. This tool was forked from
[cloud-builders-community/windows-builder](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/windows-builder).

# Maintaining this builder

Update the `versionMap` in [main.go](builder/main.go) when a new Windows SAC or
LTSC version comes out.

# Building the gke-windows-builder container

## Manually

During development you may need to manually build and run the builder from this
repository. To build the builder:

### One-time steps in your GCP project

```shell
export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
export MEMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT --format 'value(projectNumber)')@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com

# Enable the Cloud Build and Compute APIs on your project:
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com

# Assign roles. These roles are required for the builder to create the Windows
# Server VMs, to copy the workspace to a Cloud Storage bucket, to configure the
# networks to build the Docker image and to push resulting image to artifact registry:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$MEMBER --role='roles/compute.instanceAdmin'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$MEMBER --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountUser'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$MEMBER --role='roles/compute.networkViewer'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$MEMBER --role='roles/storage.admin'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$MEMBER --role='roles/artifactregistry.writer'

# Add a firewall rule named allow-winrm-ingress to allow WinRM to connect to
# Windows Server VMs to run a Docker build:
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-winrm-ingress --allow=tcp:5986 --direction=INGRESS
```

### One-time setup if you want to use internal IP only VMs

Please enable Cloud NAT in your project and create a worker pool with VPC peering to the subnet in which the windows builders will run

### Build steps

The "official" build uses Google Cloud Build to build the builder tool (a Linux
Go binary) and install it in a Docker container image that is pushed to Google
Container Registry. Run this command to invoke Cloud Build:

```shell
gcloud builds submit --config=builder/cloudbuild.yaml builder/
```

If the Cloud Build for the gke-windows-builder fails, you'll see ERROR output.
If the build succeeds then after a few minutes you should see output like:

```

```

If you visit
[gcr.io/PROJECT/gke-windows-builder](http://gcr.io/PROJECT/gke-windows-builder)
you should now see the `latest` builder image that you just built and pushed.

As part of the Cloud Build process you'll see output showing the `go build` step
that builds the Go code you may be modifying. To reduce the dev/build cycle time
when making changes to the builder's Go code, you can copy and adjust the
command from this step and run it directly (from the `builder/` subdir),
something like:

```shell
GO111MODULE=on CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /tmp/go/bin/gke-windows-builder_main
```

### Using the builder you just built (testing your changes)

The gke-windows-builder can now be used to a Windows application container as a
multi-arch container image. You can use the [example](example) application code
from this repository, or you can follow our
[tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/building-windows-multi-arch-images#creating_the_helloexe_binary_in_your_workspace)
for building a simple Hello World application container.

Create a Cloud Build configuration file, `cloudbuild.yaml`, in the same
directory as your application container's `Dockerfile`. The configuration file
must have a step that refers to the name of the gke-windows-builder that you
just built, `gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/gke-windows-builder`. You can add additional
arguments in the configuration file as well - see the [examples](example).

Once you've defined your Cloud Build configuration file, submit it to Cloud
Build:

```shell
gcloud builds submit --config=example/basic/cloudbuild.yaml example/basic/
```

This Windows multi-arch container build will take at least a few minutes to
complete.
